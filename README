Introduction
==

'Poky' is a combined cross build system and linux distribution based
upon OpenEmbedded. It features support for building X11/Matchbox/GTK
based filesystem images for various embedded devices and boards.


Required Packages
===

Running Poky on Debian based distributions requires the following
extra packages be installed;

build-essential
diffstat
texinfo
texi2html
cvs
subversion
gawk
bochsbios (to run qemux86 images)

You also need to install the qemu from http://debian.o-hand.com/. A
poky-depends deb is also available from this source which will install 
all the dependencies mentioned above for you.

Alternatively poky can build qemu itself, but for this you need the
following packages installed;

gcc-3.4
libsdl1.2-dev
zlib1g-dev

You will also need to comment out ASSUME_PROVIDED += "qemu-native"' in  
build/conf/local.conf.

Building under other distro's such as Fedora is known to work. Use the above
package names as a guide for dependencies.

Building An Image
===

Simply run;

% source poky-init-build-env
% bitbake oh-image-pda

This will result in an ext2 image and kernel for qemu arm (see scripts dir).

To build for other machine types see MACHINE in build/conf/local.conf

Other image targets such as oh-image-sdk or oh-image-core are available, 
see meta/packages/images/*.
